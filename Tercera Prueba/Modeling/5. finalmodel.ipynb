        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "The main objective of this article was to build a machine learning algorithm that would be able to identify potential defaulters and therefore reduce company loss. The best model possible would be the one that could minimize false negatives, identifying all defaulters among the client base, while also minimizing false positives, preventing clients to be wrongly classified as defaulters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meeting these requirements can be quite tricky as there is a tradeoff between precision and recall, meaning that increasing the value of one of these metrics often decreases the value of the other. Considering the importance of minimizing company loss, we decided to give more emphasis on reducing false positives, searching for the best hyperparameters that could increase the recall rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Among the three **Gradient Boosting Algorithms** tested, **XGBoost** yielded the best results, with a recall rate of 81%, although it delivered an undesired 56% of false positives. On the other hand, **LightGBM** and **CatBoost** delivered a better count of false positives, with 38% and 33% respectively, but their false negatives were substantially higher than that of XGBoost, resulting in a weaker recall rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "This article presents a classic evaluation metrics dilemma. In this case, it would be up to the company's decision-makers to analyze the big picture, with the aid of the machine learning algorithms, and decide the best plan to follow. Of course, in a future article, we can test a different approach to achieve a more desirable result, such as taking advantage of deep learning models."
